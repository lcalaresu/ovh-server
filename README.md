# OS installation on a Kimsufi-class Dedicated Server

Registering the post-installation configuration script can be done in two different ways:

* using a *custom installation*,
* creating or using a template.

In both cases, the *Post installation script link* URI should be set to  ``https://gitlab.calaresu.com/share/kimsufi-post-install/raw/master/scripts/ovh/ovh.sh``

To make sure `Docker` works as expected, make sure to select the checkbox *Use the distribution kernel*.
